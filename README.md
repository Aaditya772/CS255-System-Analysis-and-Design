# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass, who want to create an online platform for users to sign up for different packages of driving lessons and/or additional materials to take advantage of the current void in the market with regards to training students for the driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV). DriverPass wants their system to be able to, provide online classes as well as practice tests, allow on-the-road training reservations, access online from a computer or mobile device, support offline viewing of reports/data exports (such as Excel), and include role-based security permissions for employees and users.

What did you do particularly well?

One thing that I feel I did particularly well in is organzing

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
