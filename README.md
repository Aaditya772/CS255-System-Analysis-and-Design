# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass, who want to create an online platform for users to sign up for different packages of driving lessons and/or additional materials to take advantage of the current void in the market with regards to training students for the driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV). DriverPass wants their system to be able to, provide online classes as well as practice tests, allow on-the-road training reservations, access online from a computer or mobile device, support offline viewing of reports/data exports (such as Excel), and include role-based security permissions for employees and users.

What did you do particularly well?

One thing that I feel I did particularly well in is organzing the code and documents for easy readability and understanding. The various UML diagram have also been designed in a way that a person without the technical knowledge can quickly grasp the naunces and features of the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of my work on these documents that I would revise would be the UML diagrams. Although they are well organized and capture the main features, more features can be added in a more detailed manner to describe the entire system clearly.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I impimented the user's needs by understanding what are the pool of features required and out of these, which are of a comparitive higher priority. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it is the user that will be interacting with the system and so will be most affected by the design. Knowing what the user needs helps make sure the best features are avaiable quickly for efficiency.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by analyzing the requests of the client and creating various uml diagrams to describe the intended features. These diagrams will be used to discuss with the client to quickly share the plan and receive feedback. Once the plan finalized, execution starts usually with a form of an organized schedule such as a gantt chart. In the future, I will continue  to use these methods to analyze, organize, share, finalize, and manage time while working on projects, especially which are large and complex.
